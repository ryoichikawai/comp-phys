    "In Physics $t$ and $\\omega$ indicate time and angular frequency.  The forward transformation changes the function from the time domain to the frequency domain. There is some confusion regarding the sign on the exponential function.  If $\\omega$ in Eq {eq}`eq:fourier_theorem` is replaced with $-\\omega$, the theorem still holds.  That means we could call Eq.{eq}`eq:fourier_inv` forward transformation and Eq. {eq}`eq:fourier_fwd` inverse transformation.  In fact,\n",

    "Mathematically speaking, however, $t$ and $\\omega$ are just two different variables.  Apart from the prefactor $1/2\\pi$ and the sign of $\\omega$ in the exponential function, the two integrals have the identical form. $\\tilde{f}(\\omega)$ is  Fourier transform of $f(t)$ and in turn $f(t)$ is Fourier transform of $\\tilde{f}(\\omega)$.  It does not make a sense to call one as forward and the other as inverse. \n",
