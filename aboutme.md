Dr. Kawai received Ph. D from Waseda University (Tokyo, Japan) in 1985.  After that he worked at Department of Mathematics, the Imperial College of London,  IBM  T. J.  Watson Research Center (Yorktown Heights, NY), Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at the University of California, San Diego.  Throughout the period, he acquired a wide range of science including mathematical and computational skills.

In 1991, he joined the University of Alabama at Birmingham as assistant professor.  He taught a wide range of courses from basic physics such as quantum mechanics and statistical physics to biophysics. In 1997, he received The President's Award for Excellence in Teaching .  In 2021, he officially retired but continues his research and educational activities as emeritus faculty.
