    "Integrals appear everywhere in physics but many of them are too difficult to calculate analytically. Here are some examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **The period of classical oscillation** ({numref}`app:oscillation-period`):  A classical particle bound in a potential oscillates between two turning points as discussed in {numref}`app:turning-points`.  The period of oscillation can be expressed as an integral but the integrand has two integrable singularities at the turning points. The methods discussed in {numref}`sec:integrable-singularities` must be used.\n",
    "* **Thermodynamics of quamtum ideal gases** ({numref}`app:qm-ideal-gas`):  Some thermodynamic relations for Fermi gases and Bose gases are expressed with integrals known as the Fermi-Dirac integral and the Bose-Einstein integral, respectively.  The integrals are improper since the upper bound in the integrals is infinity. WE use the methods discussed in {numref}`sec:unbound-interval`."
