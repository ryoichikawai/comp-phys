    "The key step of iterative methods is how to propose a new candidate of root based on the previous candidates.  The derivative of the function provides can be a good resource to construct the  next candidate. Suppose that the $n$-th candidate $x_n$ was not good enough.  \n",

    "In order to avoid this failure, find a rough estimate of root using the bisection method and switch to the Newton-Raphson method for the further improvement.  While the bisection method is relatively robust many iterations are needed.  On the other hand, the Newton-Raphson method converges faster.  Therefore, such a hybrid method make a sense. \n"
