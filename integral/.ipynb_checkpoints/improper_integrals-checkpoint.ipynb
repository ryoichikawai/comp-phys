    "When an integral has an unbound interval or its integrand contains singularities, the integral is [_improper_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Improper_integral).  In either cases, _infinity_ is involved. The standards method discussed in {numref}`sec:piecewise-integral` does not work for such integrals.  For example, consider\n",
