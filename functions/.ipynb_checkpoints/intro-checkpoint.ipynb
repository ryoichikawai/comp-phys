    "Mathematical expressions often involves predefined functions, from elementary functions such as $\\sin(x)$ to special functions such as $H_n(x)$ (Hermite polynomials).  Such functions are not a part of python core.  Many mathematical packages provides them and you have to pick one suitable for your application. In this chapter, the packages used in this lecutre, `math`, `numpy`, `scipy`, `sympy`, and `mpmath` are introduced.\n",
