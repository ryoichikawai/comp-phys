    "Jupyter is a project to develop an interactive environment for data science and scientific computing. (See [jupyter.org](https://jupyter.org/).)  It provides a popular web-based interactive development environment (IDE), *Jupyter Notebook*.  We use a next-generation of notebook called *JupyterLab* in this book.  With JupyterLab, you can create an interactive document consisting of texts written in *Markdown* and Python codes.  In fact, this book is entirely written in JupyterLab. Since it runs in a web browser, you can use JupyterLab running on remote computers.  There are free online services that allow anyone to use their JupyterLab.  However, it is convenient to have it on your own computer since we use some extensions which may not be available at the free services.  "

Simply replace notebook with lab in the target.\n",
