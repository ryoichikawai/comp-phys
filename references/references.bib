For the Morse model, the agreement with potentials determined entirely from experimental data is within about 10\\%; it is poorer for the (exp‐6) model. However, both models afford poor agreement with the theoretical − C6r−6 dispersion attraction. Hybrid model potentials, constructed by equating the H–F repulsion with the repulsive term of the model potential and requiring a first‐order contact with the theoretical dispersion, have much too shallow a well. Possible means for obtaining improved hybrids are explored.}},
