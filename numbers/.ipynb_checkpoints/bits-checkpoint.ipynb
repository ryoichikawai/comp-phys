    "The current digital computers are mostly binary machines\\footnote{We don't consider q-bit used in quantum computers.} and use a bit $b$ as the smallest unit of information where $b=0$ or $1$ (or we write it equivalently as $b=\\{0,1\\}$). Inside a computer,  information is generally encoded in a string of bits such as $01100101000101100\\cdots$.  The number of unique expressions depends on the length of the string, which is measured as the number of bits. An $N$-bit string\n",
